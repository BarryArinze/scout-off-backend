# Documentation Index

This directory holds the operator-facing and contributor-facing documentation
for the ScoutOff backend. It exists so that finding the right doc is a lookup,
not a directory listing.

> **For contributors:** when you add a new `docs/*.md` file, add it to this
> index — pick the right group below and keep the one-line description
> accurate. A doc that isn't indexed effectively doesn't exist.
